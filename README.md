# 🕸️ Web Scraping


## 🚀 Project Overview
This project demonstrates professional-grade data extraction using Python. It covers two distinct domains: e-commerce (extracting book catalogs) and finance (capturing real-time S&P 500 company listings). The goal was to automate the transition from unstructured HTML to cleaned, analysis-ready datasets.
